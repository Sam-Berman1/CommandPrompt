<h1>CommandPrompt</h1>

<h3> About: </h3>
<p> This program is written in MIPS assembly language. It is meant to simulates a mini command prompt with commands help, echo, and exit. </p>
<h3> Usage: </h3>
<p>MARS IDE is owned and managed by Missouri State University. They describe the IDE as "a 
lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language,
intended for educational-level use with Patterson and Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design."</p>
</p>You can download it here: http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/</p>

<p>1.) After download and setup open the IDE.</br>
2.) Go to File -> Open -> and locate and open the four files.</br>
3.) When the code is visible go to settings and make sure the "assemble all files in directory" box is checked off. </br>
4.) Make sure Main.asm is open for the following steps.</br>
5.) Go to Tools -> Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator.</br>
6.) (order here is important) in IDE click build (wrench and screwdriver button) -> 
in Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator click "Connect to MIPS" -> Then in IDE click run!</p>
You will know this assembled correctly if you see "Type a command or help for a list of command options:" in the MMIO Simulator.</p>
